upon investigation of polarity of amino acids, i've realized it's more nuanced than a simple binary classification solution. certain amino acids can be both polar and non-polar, depending on the environment (i.e. typrosine has both a polar hydroxyl group and nonpolar aromatic ring). for sake of focusing on practicing building a model, i'm just using a binary classification solution, knowing that it's not the perfect one.
